You are an experienced Python developer with a strong background in building GUI applications and working with data processing libraries like `pandas` and `openpyxl`. You are tasked with building a **fully offline form application** using `tkinter` that collects user input (e.g., name, email, etc.) and saves the responses directly into an Excel file (`responses.xlsx`).


If you need to download any dependencies make sure youre in the vmsource ~/venv/FormulaireVenv/bin/activate.fish



orm to Excel (Offline & Container-Ready)

This project is a **local, offline form** built using Python that allows users to input responses into a simple GUI. Upon submission, responses are **saved to an Excel file** (`responses.xlsx`). This solution is:

- ✅ Completely offline
- ✅ Easy to use and extend
- ✅ Compatible with or without Docker
- ✅ Suitable for local record-keeping and small deployments

---

## ✨ Features

- GUI form using `tkinter`
- Input fields for user data (e.g., Name, Email)
- Data saved in `.xlsx` file using `pandas`
- No need for a web server or internet connection
- Optional Docker containerization
- Start with default question , they should be customizable after. The workflow is to have every submission equal one line in excell
with each question being one column

## 📦 Requirements

### Python Dependencies

Install requirements with:

```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl

📁 File Structure
.
├── app.py          # Python form application
├── responses.xlsx  # Excel file with responses (auto-created)
├── Dockerfile      # Optional containerization
└── README.md       # Documentation

Add timestamp to each entry


Im thinking Running the code, it opens a gui, the line is saved on each submission ( possibly through a submit button ) and it append to the xlsx in real time
